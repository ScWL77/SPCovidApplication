# SPCovidApplication

SP Covid Application is a platform for SP students to upload, view and search lesson seating photo/image , temperature as well as attendance for SPâ€™s lessons. Students will be able to upload the necessary information such as seating photo, temperature, and attendance to make sure that they do not come school even though they are sick and to take note that they are present in lessons if they are not sick. 

Eclipse IDE, Java and JavaFX were used in this project.
